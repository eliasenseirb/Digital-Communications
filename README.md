# Introduction
This repo contains the Matlab code for basic digital communication chains on **Average White Gaussian Noise** (*AWGN*) channel.
The goal of each program is to compute and plot the **Bit Error Rate** (*BER*) in function of the **Sound to Noise Ratio** (*SNR*).

There are serveral chains implemented:
- Basic chain on **baseband**.
- Basic chain on **carrier frequency**
- Based on **CP-OFDM**

To run these programs you'll need the **[Communications Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/communications.html)** from Matlab.
